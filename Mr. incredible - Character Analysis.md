[``Source``](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Parr)
Robert "Bob" Parr, also known as Mr. Incredible, is a fictional superhero who appears in Disney/Pixar's 6th animated film The Incredibles (2004) and its sequel and 20th animated film Incredibles 2 (2018). He is a superhuman that has superhuman strength, durability, and stamina.


## His Powers
[``Source``](https://disney.fandom.com/wiki/Mr._Incredible)
-   **Superhuman Strength:**  Mr. Incredible's primary superpower is his vast superhuman strength. According to Syndrome's data files of "Supers", Bob's exact lifting limit is well in excess of 66 tons, though he was previously seen bench-pressing an ALCO locomotive, which weighs 153 tons. His threat rating is 9.1, a level none of the other superheroes in his world had, making him one of the most powerful beings on the planet. Even in middle age, he is phenomenally strong, able to throw large boulders at high speed and accuracy, and be on equal footing with the Omnidroid v.8. His most impressive feats of strength is countering and overpowering the Omnidroid v.10 even as it descended straight down, showing force of over 2000 metric tons.
    -   **Superhuman Jump/Leap:**  Mr. Incredible's superhuman strength extends to all his musculature. His strong legs allow him to jump incredible heights in the air, with significant freedom in his agility and movement.
    -   **Enhanced Speed:**  His superhumanly strong leg muscles also give him a certain degree of enhanced, near-superhuman speed, as he can run significantly faster than a normal human—though neither his speed nor agility approach that of his son Dash.
        -   **Enhanced Agility:**  His superhumanly strong muscles allow him to move and perform feats of great agility a normal human being could never do without hurting himself or damaging his ligaments. Combined with his jumping ability, Mr. Incredible is able to perform some astonishing maneuvers no other normal human or even the finest of athletes could do.
-   **Invulnerability:**  Mr. Incredible is able to withstand tremendous amounts of physical trauma and blunt forces, including multi-story falls, the direct impact of a train, breaking through brick walls, and surviving 100,000 volts of electricity under torture (though the extreme electrocution rendered him weak and clearly hurt him significantly). However he is not indestructible; he can still be cut with very hard metals and a suitable amount of force. Despite the fact that Mr. Incredible has a near-superhuman degree of resistance to impacts and pain, things that produce a tremendous amount of blunt force can still hurt him or even pierce his skin. This is shown when he is about to stop the passenger train, he winces just before it hits him. According to director *Brad Bird*, it was him "preparing for the fact that it's going to hurt". This was shown again during his battle with the Omnidroid v.8 on Nomanisan Island when the robot tried to pin Mr. Incredible to the ground but only succeeded in slicing his left shoulder, causing it to bleed. In a deleted scene, however, his body could withstand being cut by a butcher knife, and also dent it in the process, as demonstrated when he was trying to leave some food for the grill, and accidentally chopped his fingers. This also in a way acted as a weakness as it would have given away his identity to their new neighbors, so he had to fake injury in order to maintain cover. Also, at the beginning of The Incredibles movie, when a normal thug threatened him by pointing a gun at him point-blank, Mr. Incredible showed no concern or preoccupation getting shot by a low-caliber bullet. However he may have gestured it to simply intimidate the armed individual. In other instances he has tried to avoid gunfire.
-   **Enhanced Senses:**  Mr. Incredible also has very sharp senses. This power is seen when  *Bomb Voyage*  is about to blow open the vault of a skyrise building; Mr. Incredible is able to hear the faint beeping of the bomb from the other side of a thick wall. Also, when he arrived home after some hours of vigilantism, he rapidly noticed the presence of another person in the room, which was Helen.

## Character Analysis
[``Source``](https://www.charactour.com/hub/characters/view/Bob-ParrMr-Incredible.The-Incredibles)

**Living…** in ho-hum suburban anonymity. Once a prominent and well-loved superhero, Mr. Incredible took on the life of Bob Parr fulltime after he was sued for saving a man from committing suicide and subsequently forced into hiding. Bob always enjoyed his double life — “Who wants the pressure of being super all the time?” — but he never wanted Mr. Incredible to retire for good.

**Profession…** insurance claims agent at Insuricare. Bob commutes to the downtown Insuricare office, where he responds to insurance claims all day from his small cubicle. Bob often takes pity on the customers and tells them how to navigate Insuricare’s loopholes. His diminutive boss, Gilbert Huph, has a massive Napoleonic complex and reprimands Bob for letting the customers “penetrate the bureaucracy.”

**Interests…** fighting crime, even though he’s supposed to be a civilian now. On Wednesday nights, Bob goes out “bowling” with his best friend Lucius Best (aka the superhero Frozone). They sit in the car listening to the police scanner, waiting for some crime to go down so they can dish out vigilante justice, like the good old days.

**Relationship Status…** married to Helen Parr, aka Elastigirl. Together they have three children, Violet, Dash and Jack-Jack. Helen had little trouble discarding her superhero past and turning her focus to raising a family, but fifteen years later, Bob still pines for the glory day. His “obsession with being undervalued” puts a strain on their relationship.

**Challenge…** stopping Syndrome’s dastardly plot. Bob is approached by a mysterious woman named Mirage, who offers him a handsome sum to fly out to a tropical island and defeat her agency’s rogue robot. Able to resume his activities as Mr. Incredible, with a boost to his bank account and self-esteem, Bob has a new lease on life. But when he comes face to face with Mirage’s vindictive boss Syndrome, he finds himself in a fight to stay alive.

**Personality…** hotheaded but good-natured. Bob genuinely wants to be Mr. Incredible to save lives and make the world a better place, but he also enjoyed the perks of being superhero, like basking in the adulation of the masses. Once resigned to civilian life, he has frequent anger issues, which cause to him lose control of his powers and break things, which only exacerbates his anger; it’s a vicious cycle.


## His behaviour
[``Source``](https://www.cram.com/essay/Mr-Guilty-A-Characteristic-Hero-In-The/PJFCBEQKJ5G)
Incredible is designed to be a strong, selfish and a determined hero. We can appreciate and despise Mr. Incredible, at different points in the film. He is a typical heroic father, saving the world but he doesn't always consider his family. Mr incredible has amazing strength. He is able to carry trains, cars and big heavy rock statues and anything that a normal human can’t carry. For Mr Incredible to be able to carry this much weight he must have huge muscles and he has to train as much as possible to achieve this. The fact that he is strong makes us like him as we feel safe around strong people because they can help us. He is selfish in so many ways. At one time in the film Mr. Incredible leaves his family back at home while he is enjoying in heroic activitiy.

## His strengths
[``Source``](https://disney.fandom.com/wiki/Mr._Incredible)
-   **Expert Strategist:**  Being a veteran superhero, years of field experience and super-heroic actions allow him to rapidly formulate effective strategies to deal with opponents who cannot be bested by his strength alone. It also allows him to work well with other heroes he's familiar with and take advantage of their powers in concert with his own.
-   **Expert Hand-To-Hand Combatant:**  Mr. Incredible's experience and years of practicing have turned him into a excellent unarmed combatant. Also, shown by the fighting pose he adopted when detecting his wife Helen's presence (thinking she was an intruder).
-   **Skilled Mathematician:**  Bob is shown to be very good in mathematical tasks: in his first scenes as an insurance employee, he was able to remember and repeat complex serial numbers of documents, while in the second movie he was able to understand and resolve Dash' math homework and successfully teach him in the span of a night.

## Weaknesses
[``Source``](https://disney.fandom.com/wiki/Mr._Incredible)
-   **Durability**: Mr. Incredible doesn't appear to have any superhuman weaknesses, but is as vulnerable as anyone to hubris from the veneration of his "glory days" and in middle age, he has a bad back. However, in a deleted scene, it was implied that his superhuman durability was in itself a weakness, as it would have exposed him when his fingers dented a butcher knife when he accidentally chopped his hand with it, forcing him to act fast and fake injury, and later allowed him to be identified by one of the neighbors, an agent of Syndrome.
-   **Uncontrollable Strength**: His immense strength can also be a huge weakness he often has difficulty controlling, as shown when he constantly breaks or dents objects, such as his car and a small plate. It also became a problem when he threw Huph through five walls, which was much harder than he intended.

-   **Lava (Possibly):** Despite being nearly invulnerable, he is shown to have an aversion to lava, suggesting he is not completely invincible and can be hurt and ultimately killed by molten substances.

## His back story (History)
[``Source``](https://www.writeups.org/mr-incredible-the-incredibles-bob-parr/)

Mr Incredible was his world’s most famed and lauded super-hero (supers, as they are called popularly), until a mishap while preventing a potential suicide led to a lawsuit for damages. This triggered not only an avalanche of personal-injury lawsuits against Mr Incredible personally, but a public backlash of opinion against supers in general.

Most of them were forced to go underground to keep from being sued to death.

Mr Incredible and his new wife,  Elastigirl, retired and became simple Mr and Mrs Parr, and started raising a family.

Cut to 15 years later.

## The character creation story

###  Personality
[``Source``](https://pixar.fandom.com/wiki/Bob_Parr#Personality)
Bob is kind, friendly, brave, heroic, and pleasant. He still loves his wife, even though he does not spend so much time with his family and constantly goes off with Lucius for some crime fighting. His NSA file described him as easily distracted and unable to prioritize. Bob's commitment to doing what is right is so strong that he displays it even when not involved in heroics. In the sequel, Bob has learned to keep his pride and ego somewhat in check. While initially jealous that Helen was chosen to be the face of the superhero legalization campaign over him, he swallowed his pride and was ultimately the one who convinced her to do it, even admitting that it was for his sake after claiming it was for their children.

### Appearance
